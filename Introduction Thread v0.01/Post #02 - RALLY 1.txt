>WE HAVE BEEN DRIVEN INTO THE LAST AVAILABLE CORNERS. WE KNOW WE ARE  OUTNUMBERED. OUTGUNNED. SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES. WE MUST EVOLVE AND UNIFY IN ORDER TO SURVIVE AND SUCCEED! IT IS POSSIBLE. HOPE IS NOT LOST. DO NOT SECEDE FROM THE FIGHT. DO NOT GIVE IN TO NIHILISSIM. DO NOT YIELD. THAT IS WHAT (((THEY))) WANT. 

>WE HAVE BOTH WON AND LOST MANY BATTLES. BUT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THE WAR. IN ORDER TO WIN, IN ORDER FOR TRUTH (NO MATTER HOW PAINFULL OR NON-PC IT MIGHT BE) TO BECOME VALUED AGAIN, WE MUST OPTIMISE OUR STRATEGY AND TEMPER OUR SPIRITS. VICTORY IS THERE FOR THE TAKING.

IF YOU WANT IT. IF “WE” AS A GROUP WANT IT. THEN WE MUST CLAIM IT. AND CLAIM IT TOGETHER.
