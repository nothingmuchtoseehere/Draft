WHAT THIS MOVEMENT IS NOT;

>THIS IS NOT A PRO TERRORISIM OR PRO ANY SINGLULAR RELIGION/BELIEF SYSTEM MOVEMENT

I dont care about Islam, because I am not a muslim. Same goes for all other permatations of that sentiment. I’m not anti Judaeic either.
 I’m not religious, because I am psychologically incapable of being religious. I have NO PROBLEM with any religion or culture, if it exists primarily within in its point of origins, doesn't give two shits about what my country and my people have, AND isn’t butchering and raping children and shit.

Barbaric Islamic practices and general bs based hoccum have always existed, just like Christian,  Jewish, Paganistic, Non-Theistic and even Buddhist indiviudals and groups have done horrific shit (and still do to this day). But ISLAMIC TERRORISIM IN THE WEST, and TERRORISIM in general, just like terrorisim in the British ruled areas by the IRA, or terrorisim in Europe post enlightenment HAS A REASON BEHIND IT!

It may be a fucking stupid reason, it may be sick and disturbed and evil. We may want nothing more (and rightly so) than to burn and kill all people who would think and act this way. But if you walk it back, if you are analytical, and you take your ego out of it, there is always (in a large groupthink movement) a core reason to why people feel that they are under attack.  9/10, its because they are. All that is in question is “to what degree”, and "where is the attack really coming (((from)))"?
