THIS IS NOT AN ETHNOCENTRIC/WHITE NATIONALIST/MGTOW MOVEMENT.

>This does not mean that race proud white nationalists/non-white nationalits or frustrated perma-virgins who haven’t found their unicorn are not welcome. It just means that you need to realise that the people who dont look like you, dont believe in all the things you do, but actually have the same or a compatible valueset to you don't get the public MSM spotlight, and its about time they did, and its to both your own, and their benefit for honest objective opinions and critisims to be discussed in an open level field.

White nationalisim as a response to limp dicked left wing “white guilt” pandering is an understandable and entirely predictable reaction. If you were white, and you are proud of your heritage, and the MSM was forced by SMS (Social Media Stigmata) to piss and shit on all the good that has been done in the past, and highlight only the bad, why wouldn’t you want to rebel? Its not your fault that people who are being shitty “right now” are just blaming anglo-europeans and their ancestors for their own failings and attitudes "right now", giving in to a nihilistic, defeatist attitude, (whether on account of their culture, their governance, or something else) instead of doing what you, me and everyone else of any colour, religion, ethnicity or sub-group with a brain should do, which is respect what data and statistical analysis shows, whilst also judging on individual merit and hard work.
