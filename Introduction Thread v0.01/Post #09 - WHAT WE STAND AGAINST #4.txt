>WHAT THIS MOVEMENT IS NOT;

THIS IS NOT A NAZI/KEKISTAN SYMPATHETIC MOVEMENT

>FFS, grow up, and turn off your memeflag you fucking fags. (Someone has to say it)

-To KEKistani’s - Clean your room, brush your teeth, do your fucking homework, and go for a walk outside.

-To NAZI larpers - All the above, with a friendly reminder that; 
>Nazi’s were SOCIALISTS
>The brownshirts were (more or less) PRIVELAGE CHECKERS
>Germans had/debatebly still have NO SENSE OF HUMOR, 
and the icing on top of the cake, 
>Hitler tried and FAILED TO GET HIS LIBERAL ARTS DEGREE.

>I could be wrong, but these four things that you are supposedly not pro IRL, the Nazi’s were for (dont take shit to seriously). Doesn’t mean that some of their core motivations for change weren’t valid. It doesn't mean that many of the things that Hitler pointed out concerning society in his day weren't true. If they weren't true then the Nazi's would never have gotten as far as they did, because they would never have been able to convice as many people as they did to join them. It just means that being an edgy fag is for edgy fags and you need to go back to plebbit if you aren't willing to grow a pair.
