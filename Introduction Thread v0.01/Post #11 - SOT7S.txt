I am only one person. I am a hardworking, non-wealthy, average nobody like most. I am wealthy in mind and family, but that's mostly it. Thats worth more than any ammount of money to me, but it also means that I cannot commit as much time as I would like to this, like most people and their projects. I also cannot afford all the tools I would like, like most people. I do not have all the knowledge and skills I would like to refine things, like most people. But maybe I can spread this to a point where one persons time and resources are no longer necessary to hold it up.

Thats what I hope at least.

I will try to save all relevant threads and process as much of your posted content as I am able.
